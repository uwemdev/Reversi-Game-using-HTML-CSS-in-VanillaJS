About Reversi Game

The Reversi Game is a game application coded purely in JavaScript. This program can be played by two players or in single-player mode using the mouse. The game follows the original rules of Reversi, where players take turns placing their pieces, which are colored black and white. When a player places a black piece such that it surrounds one or more white pieces between another black piece, those white pieces will be flipped to black. The first player to fill the board with the majority of their color wins the game.
